# What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

# About This Image

This default distribution is governed by the Elastic License, and includes the [full set of free features](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

# How to use this image

**Note:** Pulling an images requires using a specific version number tag. The `latest` tag is not supported.

For Elasticsearch versions prior to 6.4.0 a full list of images, tags, and documentation can be found at [docker.elastic.co](https://www.docker.elastic.co/).

For full Elasticsearch documentation see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html).

**The commands below are intended for deploying in a development context only. For production installation and configuration, see [Install Elasticsearch with Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/docker.html).**

## Running in Development Mode

Create user defined network (useful for connecting to other services attached to the same network (e.g. Kibana)):

```console
$ docker network create somenetwork
```

Run Elasticsearch:

```console
$ docker run -d --name elasticsearch --net somenetwork -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:tag
```

## Running in Production Mode

See [Install Elasticsearch with Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/docker.html)

# Image Variants

The `amd64/elasticsearch` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

## `amd64/elasticsearch:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.

## `amd64/elasticsearch:<version>-alpine`

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).
